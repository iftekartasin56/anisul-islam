        I can't talk to you without feeling honor.
        I can't see you without feeling wonder.
        I can't touch you without feeling pure.
        I can't feel you without wanting more.
        I can't hold you without feeling safe.
        I can't kiss you without feeling great.
        I can't miss you without feeling pain.
        I can't meet you without wanting to again.
        I can't watch you without feeling awe.
        I can't love you without feeling loved.
        I can't lay with you without feeling passion.
        I can't stay away without feeling rationed.
        I can't dream of you without sleeping soundly.
        I can't cope without you around me.
        I can't sleep without you in the bed.
        I can't be alive without feeling your breath.
        I can't think without you on my mind.
        I can't leave without feeling unkind,
        But most of all,
        I can't exist without you in my life.
